| November 10, 2024 | Today we built the basic drivetrain. It is a 4 wheel drive powered by 2 motors. The gear ratio is 4:3 (48:36) for speed. After building the drivetrain, the Eric started working on the catapult, at the end (12 PM), the skeleton of the catapult was mostly finished. Martin, in the mean while was working on the catching mechanism, where it catches the balls passed by alliances. He plans for a way to expand/shrink it using pneumatics, but he is only done the skeleton as well. He also experimented with pneumatics in the mean while. [Here](https://youtube.com/shorts/G3R-JmqAIaA?feature=share) is a video of him goofing around with the newly unpacked pneumatics.  ![This is an image of our catapult when it is fully down.](resources/catapult_contracted.jpg) This is an image of our catapult when it is fully down. ![This is an image of our catapult when it is slightly higher.](resources/catapult_expanded.jpg) This is an image of our catapult when it is slightly higher. ![This is an image of our funnel is contracted.](resources/funnel_contracted.jpg) This is an image of our funnel is contracted. ![This is an image of our funnel when it is expanded.](resources/funnel_expanded.jpg) This is an image of our funnel when it is expanded. | For programming today we coded the drivetrain. We are using tank drive. The code has a init function to initialise the motors and possibly other parts in the future. After initialising is done, it runs a recursion function (which basically acts like a forever loop) that has the code for tank drive in it. Using recursion functions, there is a lot more agility since you can skip back and forth between functions, etc. A key to the tank drive code is we check if the absolute value of the controller joystick is greater then 5 before taking action. The Vex IQ controller has inaccurate calibrations/sensors and it often returns a small value when it is in the origin position. Meaning that the robot will slowly drive even when the controller is left idle. This is not a code issue but a controller issue. In order to take care of that, we make sure that the controller position is greater than a small value like 5 to make sure that doesn't happen. At around 10:35 AM, we finally got everyone onto the Github. Since Martin forgot to bring his adapter, he had to run off of Eric's computer. After downloading and running a few times, the same error occurred. It turned out there was an issue with recursion and there was most likely a max recursion limit, like python. Removing the recursion limit fixed the issues. He also reversed some motors to make the drivetrain run properly. Now it works perfectly fine. ![This is an image of our code for tank drive.](resources/tankdrive.png) This is an image of our code for tank drive. | This is the first day of IQ and we planned to stay from 9 AM to 12 PM (3hrs). We ended up finishing the drivetrain at around 10:15 AM. |

Today is also remembrance day. Martin came before Eric, so he took some pictures and edited yesterday's logbook. Eric will continue to work on the catapult while Martin continues to struggle with the funnel. Today we plan for our session from 9:00 AM to 1:30 PM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                        |
