| November 10, 2024 | Today we built the basic drivetrain. It is a 4 wheel drive powered by 2 motors. The gear ratio is 4:3 (48:36) for speed. | For programming today we coded the drivetrain. We are using tank drive. The code has a init function to initialise the motors and possibly other parts in the future. After initialising is done, it runs a recursion function (which basically acts like a forever loop) that has the code for tank drive in it. Using recursion functions, there is a lot more agility since you can skip back and forth between functions, etc. A key to the tank drive code is we check if the absolute value of the controller joystick is greater then 5 before taking action. The Vex IQ controller has inaccurate calibrations/sensors and it often returns a small value when it is in the origin position. Meaning that the robot will slowly drive even when the controller is left idle. This is not a code issue but a controller issue. In order to take care of that, we make sure that the controller position is greater than a small value like 5 to make sure that doesn't happen. At around 10:35 AM, we finally got everyone onto the Github. Since Martin forgot to bring his adapter, he had to run off of Eric's computer. After downloading and running a few times, the same error occurred. It turned out there was an issue with recursion and there was most likely a max recursion limit, like python. Removing the recursion limit fixed the issues. He also reversed some motors to make the drivetrain run properly. Now it works perfectly fine. | This is the first day of IQ and we planned to stay from 9 AM to 12 PM (3hrs). We ended up finishing the drivetrain at around 10:15 AM. |
