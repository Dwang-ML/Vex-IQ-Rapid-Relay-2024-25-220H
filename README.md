| November 10, 2024 |                                                                                                                                                                      Today we built the basic drivetrain. It is a 4 wheel drive powered by 2 motors. The gear ratio is 4:3 (48:36) for speed. After building the drivetrain, the Eric started working on the catapult, at the end (12 PM), the skeleton of the catapult was mostly finished. Martin, in the mean while was working on the catching mechanism, where it catches the balls passed by alliances. He plans for a way to expand/shrink it using pneumatics, but he is only done the skeleton as well. He also experimented with pneumatics in the mean while. [Here](https://youtube.com/shorts/G3R-JmqAIaA?feature=share) is a video of him goofing around with the newly unpacked pneumatics.  ![This is an image of our catapult when it is fully down.](resources/catapult_contracted.jpg) This is an image of our catapult when it is fully down. ![This is an image of our catapult when it is slightly higher.](resources/catapult_expanded.jpg) This is an image of our catapult when it is slightly higher. ![This is an image of our funnel is contracted.](resources/funnel_contracted.jpg) This is an image of our funnel is contracted. ![This is an image of our funnel when it is expanded.](resources/funnel_expanded.jpg) This is an image of our funnel when it is expanded.                                                                                                                                                                      | For programming today we coded the drivetrain. We are using tank drive. The code has a init function to initialise the motors and possibly other parts in the future. After initialising is done, it runs a recursion function (which basically acts like a forever loop) that has the code for tank drive in it. Using recursion functions, there is a lot more agility since you can skip back and forth between functions, etc. A key to the tank drive code is we check if the absolute value of the controller joystick is greater then 5 before taking action. The Vex IQ controller has inaccurate calibrations/sensors and it often returns a small value when it is in the origin position. Meaning that the robot will slowly drive even when the controller is left idle. This is not a code issue but a controller issue. In order to take care of that, we make sure that the controller position is greater than a small value like 5 to make sure that doesn't happen. At around 10:35 AM, we finally got everyone onto the Github. Since Martin forgot to bring his adapter, he had to run off of Eric's computer. After downloading and running a few times, the same error occurred. It turned out there was an issue with recursion and there was most likely a max recursion limit, like python. Removing the recursion limit fixed the issues. He also reversed some motors to make the drivetrain run properly. Now it works perfectly fine. ![This is an image of our code for tank drive.](resources/tankdrive.png) This is an image of our code for tank drive. | This is the first day of IQ and we planned to stay from 9 AM to 12 PM (3hrs). We ended up finishing the drivetrain at around 10:15 AM. |
| November 11, 2024 | Today is our second day working on the robot! Today is also remembrance day. Martin came before Eric, so he took some pictures and edited yesterday's logbook. Eric will continue to work on the catapult while Martin continues to struggle with the funnel. Today we plan for our session from 9:00 AM to 1:30 PM. The mechanism with the motors for catapult are still in development. We had to blur "220H" out because we changed our team number to 220Z. The intake still needs some work though. Eric Jones then experimented with pneumatics, but failed to make it work the way he preferred. After some innovating, we managed to get a PISTON POWERED catapult working! Using some strategies from VexV5, one solenoid can power 4 pistons. Our intake can inconsistently score both of the balls at once. Consistency still needs to be improved. Martin was working on the funnel, the funnel is big and it can catch at a wide range. Here is a [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/dzsKSxCLGt8?feature=share) of us testing the funnel. ![This is an image of new funnel that has been redesigned. It is now 4 sides instead of 8, so save pieces and weight.](resources/funnel_updated.png) This is an image of new funnel that has been redesigned.

He eventually found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9IYBMD6cpQ) by team 7163B. Their plan was time saving and efficient. Martin will check if this is breaks any rules, if it doesn't, then this will most likely be the plan that we stick to. No coding was actually done since Martin was mostly working on the funnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   We think the robot might be out of size. I also reminded Eric J to send me and intro for the logbook, which he completely forgot.    |

Eric J started working on redesigning the catapult, since our robot is WAY over 15" tall. Martin started assembling the flywheels for intake, he is using 40t sprockets with an alternation of thick and thin wires. In order to keep the distance between the sprockets even under the tension of the rubber bands, he filled the center with black half spacers.
